Disassembly of the sound driver used in "*ONE PIECE 〜夢のルフィ海賊団誕生!〜*", with a few edits for convenience.
This is a later version of the driver used in King of Fighters '96 for the Game Boy, located at <https://github.com/Kak2X/kof96.git>.

## Building
- Run **build_rom.cmd** to build the sound driver alongside a simple player wrapper.
- Run **build_gbs.cmd** to generate a standalone `.gbs` file.

# Original version
You can find the original version of the driver under the tag `original`. 
The built ROM is a cut down version of the game with the sound test accessible by pressing Start during the company logos.
